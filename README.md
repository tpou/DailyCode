## Problem 1:
Given a list of number and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]`, return `true` since `10 + 7` is `17`.
*Bonus*: Can you do it in one pass.

## Problem 2:
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`. What if you can't use division.

## Problem 206: 
Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array.
For example, given the array `["a", "b", "c"]` and the permutation `[2, 1, 0]`, will return `["c", "b", "a"]`.

## Problem 211:
Given a string an a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurences of the pattern in the string. 
For example, given the string `"abracadabra"` and the pattern `"abr"`, you should return `[0,7]`.
